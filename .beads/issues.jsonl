Check if auto-flush goroutine is running\n2. Verify debounce timer is being triggered on CreateIssue()\n3. Check for errors/panics in background export\n4. Verify auto-flush is enabled by default\n5.

After rebuilding (`go build -o bd ./cmd/bd`), auto-export works perfectly.\n\n**Resolution:**\nUsers experiencing this issue need to:\n1. Rebuild bd: `go build -o bd ./cmd/bd`\n2. Install updated binary: `sudo mv bd /usr/local/bin/` (or appropriate path)\n3. Verify: `bd version` should show 0.9.5+\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Auto-export uses 5-second debounce (configurable at main.go:36)\n- Exports are atomic (writes to .tmp, then renames)\n- Only dirty issues are exported (incremental updates)\n- Works correctly in production use\n\n**Follow-up:**\nConsider adding a version check warning if user's binary is outdated (bd-408).","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-14T14:43:06.906901-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-15T16:27:21.957164-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-15T03:01:29.542237-07:00"}

Add `schema_version` or `bd_version` to metadata table during init\n2. Check version in PersistentPreRun (cmd/bd/main.go)\n3. Warn if binary version \u003c DB version\n4. Suggest: 'Your bd binary (v0.9.3) is older than this database (v0.9.5). Rebuild: go build -o bd ./cmd/bd'\n\n**Edge cases:**\n- Dev builds (show commit hash?)\n- Backwards compatibility (older DBs should work with newer binaries)\n- Don't warn on every command (maybe once per session?)\n\n**Related:** Fixes confusion from bd-182 (auto-export not working with old binary)","notes":"**Implementation Complete:**\n\n✅ Added version metadata storage during `bd init` (init.go:59-63)\n✅ Added `checkVersionMismatch()` function (main.go:301-345)\n✅ Integrated version check into PersistentPreRun (main.go:98-99)\n✅ Tested both scenarios:\n   - Outdated binary: Clear warning with rebuild instructions\n   - Newer binary: Info message that DB will be auto-upgraded\n✅ No warnings on subsequent runs (version updated automatically)\n\n**How it works:**\n1. On `bd init`: Stores current version in metadata table\n2. On every command: Checks stored version vs binary version\n3. If mismatch:\n   - Binary \u003c DB version → Warn: outdated binary\n   - Binary \u003e DB version → Info: auto-upgrading DB\n4. Always updates stored version to current (future-proof)\n\n**Files modified:**\n- cmd/bd/init.go: Store version on init\n- cmd/bd/main.go: checkVersionMismatch() + integration\n\n**Testing:**\n```bash\n# Simulate old binary\nsqlite3 .beads/default.db \"UPDATE metadata SET value='0.9.99' WHERE key='bd_version';\"\nbd ready  # Shows warning\n\n# Normal use (versions match)\nbd ready  # No warning\n```\n\n**Edge cases handled:**\n- Empty version (old DB): Silently upgrade\n- Metadata errors: Skip check (defensive)\n- Dev builds: String comparison (works for 0.9.5 vs 0.9.6)\n\nFixes bd-182 confusion (users won't run outdated binaries unknowingly).","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-15T01:07:02.012291-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-15T16:27:21.966999-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-15T03:01:29.548677-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-197","depends_on_id":"bd-182","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-10-15T01:07:02.078326-07:00","created_by":"auto-import"}]}

Git checkout sets mtime to 'now', not original commit time\n2. Auto-import compares JSONL mtime vs DB mtime (line 181 in main.go)\n3. If DB was recently modified (agents working), mtime check fails\n4. Auto-import silently returns without feedback\n5. Agents continue with stale database state\n\nThis caused issues in VC project where 3 parallel agents:\n- Pulled updated .beads/issues.jsonl from git\n- Auto-import didn't trigger (JSONL appeared older than DB)\n- Agents couldn't find their assigned issues\n- Agents exported from wrong database, corrupting JSONL","design":"Recommended approach: Checksum-based sync (option 3 from original design)\n\n## Solution: Hash-based content comparison\n\nReplace mtime comparison with JSONL content hash comparison:\n\n1. **Compute JSONL hash on startup**:\n   - SHA256 hash of .beads/issues.jsonl contents\n   - Fast enough for typical repos (\u003c1MB = ~20ms)\n   - Only computed once per command invocation\n\n2. **Store last import hash in DB**:\n   - Add metadata table if not exists: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS metadata (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)\n   - Store hash after successful import: INSERT OR REPLACE INTO metadata (key, value) VALUES ('last_import_hash', '\u003chash\u003e')\n   - Query on startup: SELECT value FROM metadata WHERE key = 'last_import_hash'\n\n3. **Compare hashes instead of mtimes**:\n   - If JSONL hash != stored hash: auto-import (content changed)\n   - If JSONL hash == stored hash: skip import (no changes)\n   - If no stored hash: fall back to mtime comparison (backward compat)\n\n4. **Update autoImportIfNewer() in cmd/bd/main.go**:\n   - Lines 155-279 currently use mtime comparison (line 181)\n   - Replace with hash comparison\n   - Keep mtime as fallback for old DBs without metadata table\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### New storage interface method:\n```go\n// In internal/storage/storage.go\ntype Storage interface {\n    // ... existing methods ...\n    GetMetadata(ctx context.Context, key string) (string, error)\n    SetMetadata(ctx context.Context, key, value string) error\n}\n```\n\n### Migration:\n```go\n// In internal/storage/sqlite/sqlite.go init\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS metadata (\n    key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    value TEXT NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\n### Updated autoImportIfNewer():\n```go\nfunc autoImportIfNewer() {\n    jsonlPath := findJSONLPath()\n    \n    // Check if JSONL exists\n    jsonlData, err := os.ReadFile(jsonlPath)\n    if err != nil {\n        return // No JSONL, skip\n    }\n    \n    // Compute current hash\n    hasher := sha256.New()\n    hasher.Write(jsonlData)\n    currentHash := hex.EncodeToString(hasher.Sum(nil))\n    \n    // Get last import hash from DB\n    ctx := context.Background()\n    lastHash, err := store.GetMetadata(ctx, \"last_import_hash\")\n    if err != nil {\n        // No metadata support (old DB) - fall back to mtime comparison\n        autoImportIfNewerByMtime()\n        return\n    }\n    \n    // Compare hashes\n    if currentHash == lastHash {\n        return // No changes, skip import\n    }\n    \n    // Content changed - import\n    if err := importJSONLSilent(jsonlPath, jsonlData); err != nil {\n        return // Import failed, skip\n    }\n    \n    // Store new hash\n    _ = store.SetMetadata(ctx, \"last_import_hash\", currentHash)\n}\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Git-proof**: Works regardless of file timestamps\n- **Universal**: Works with git, Dropbox, rsync, manual edits\n- **Backward compatible**: Falls back to mtime for old DBs\n- **Efficient**: SHA256 is fast (~20ms for 1MB)\n- **Accurate**: Only imports when content actually changed\n- **No user action**: Fully automatic, invisible\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\nFor very large repos (\u003e10MB JSONL):\n- Only hash if mtime changed (combine both checks)\n- Use incremental hashing if metadata table tracks line count\n- Consider sampling hash (first 1MB + last 1MB)\n\nBut start simple - full hash is fast enough for 99% of use cases.\n\n## Rollout Plan\n\n1. Add metadata table + Get/SetMetadata methods (backward compatible)\n2. Update autoImportIfNewer() with hash logic + mtime fallback\n3. Test with old and new DBs\n4. Ship in next minor version (v0.10.0)\n5. Document in CHANGELOG as \"more reliable auto-import\"\n6. Git hooks remain optional but unnecessary for most users","acceptance_criteria":"- Auto-import works correctly after git pull\n- Agents in parallel workflows see consistent database state\n- Clear feedback when import is needed\n- Performance acceptable for large databases\n- Works in both git and non-git workflows\n- Documentation updated with multi-agent best practices","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-14T14:43:06.941275-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-15T16:27:22.045119-07:00"}
